# horcrux

Horcrux is a CLI utility that will take a file and use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme to break it into multiple files. It is currently a work in progress, and it is not yet functional.

For those wondering where the name came from, Horcrux is an item from the Harry Potter series of books (spoliers in the link): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Horcruxes
